        <h2>I smoked from 1989-2015, and I knew every exhausting day that I needed to quit or else my lungs are going to give out. Then my son was born prematurely. I stayed in the hospital for 3 months in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for 2 months in New Westminister and then a month in Kelowna. My son saved my life.</h2>

        <h3>I began to take better care of myself</h3>
        <p>I learned to eat right and I am slowly getting back into exercising and healing my body from years of damage. I've always wanted to be a model but I'm not 5'9." But there is no reason why I can't be a commercial model. I applied to World Management and created a portfolio and was able to appear in their sister magazine "Portfolio." Nothing is happening more with that, but at least i've tried putting my foot in the door. Maybe in the next life I will be a model or actress. I always pictured myself being an actress.</p>

        <h3>My Son Dabbs and I are very happy and healty today</h3>
        <p>I love taking my son to events. For us, going out shopping is a treat. We like to frequent bowling and go to the movies once in awhile. I just got my driver's license 5 years ago so now I can go traveling, which I hope to one day take him to Disneyland.</p>
